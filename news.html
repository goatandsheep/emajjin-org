            Emajjin Children's Foundation supports Canadian charities that focus on children with disabilities or those who are disadvantaged.
            A new charity is chosen every year to be the recipient of their fund-raising efforts. 2016's recipient charity
            is Sleeping Children Around the World. The gala took place on Wednesday October 5, 2016. Legendary hockey player
            Dave Dryden was the guest speaker. There was a formal sit down dinner, silent auction, raffle, entertainment
            and a live auction. Unique gifts, sports tickets, golf packages and much more were available for bidding.</p>

        <h2>ProSoft Employee&rsquo;s Foundation Recipient of Belden&rsquo;s Matching Gift Program </h2>
        <b>June 20, 2016</b><br />

        <img alt="Belden Prosoft Matching Gift Program" class="img-center img-fit" src="img/Belden_title.jpg" /><br />
        <br />

        <p>Giving back to the community can be a worthwhile endeavor, an opportunity to improve the lives of others and a chance
            for an individual to be an active part of their community. For ProSoft&rsquo;s, Anil Sanwalka, senior engineer,
            philanthropy has taken on a new level of importance. Sanwalka and his wife, Jyoti, are the founders of the Emajjin
            (EE-MAJ-JIN) Children&rsquo;s Foundation, a recent recipient of Belden&rsquo;s matching gift program.</p>

        <p>Sanwalka, who joined ProSoft in 2012, and his wife established the foundation nearly three years ago after being
            inspired by their special needs child. <img alt="Jyoti and Anil Sanwalka" class="img-center" src="img/Jyoti_anil_2015_gala.jpg"
            /><br /> The couple wanted to create a foundation centered on providing assistance for children&rsquo;s charities
            through a focus on fundraising. Each year, Emajjin selects one partner charity to benefit from the foundation&rsquo;s
            yearly fundraising campaign. In 2015, Emajjin partnered with the Pathways to Education organization. The foundation
            was able raise over $20,000 for Pathways to Education after receiving a contribution from Belden&rsquo;s matching
            gift program.</p>

        <p>After reading about the matching program in a letter from John Stroup, Sanwalka reached out about having Emajjin
            selected as a recipient of the program.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;I didn&#39;t know anything about the matching gift program and then I got John&#39;s letter describing the
            it,&rdquo; said Sanwalka. &ldquo;I reached out to John with an email and within a couple of hours, he had responded
            to me. I got an email saying we were eligible to do this and that was it.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The selection as a matching program recipient happened to coincided with Emajjin&rsquo;s annual fundraising gala.
            Each year, the foundation holds a fundraising gala focused on that year&rsquo;s chosen charitable partner. At
            Emajjin&rsquo;s 2015 gala benefiting Pathways to Education, Sanwalka was inspired to drive more donations, after
            knowing that Belden would be matching Emajjin&rsquo;s donations</p>

        <p>&ldquo;While we were at the gala, I was thinking about Belden doubling my contribution, so I went up on stage and
            said I&#39;ll match anybody who puts in up to $1,000,&rdquo; said Sanwalka. &ldquo;Within five minutes, I had
            $1000. So I said I&#39;ll go up to $2000, and I got that. So with my individual contribution, the attendees&rsquo;
            matching contributions and Belden&#39;s matching contribution, we raised over $9,000 in total donations.&rdquo;</p>

        <p>The funds donated to Pathways to Education will allow the non-profit to continue to ensure that Canadian students
            finish high school. The mission of organization is to identify at-risk students and work to develop plans to
            provide those students with needed supplies to make sure they graduate high school.</p>

        <p>Following the success of the 2015 fundraising campaign for Pathways to Education, Sanwalka said he looks to continue
            the work of the Emjjain Children&rsquo;s Foundation in funding charities making a difference in the lives of
            children.

        <p>&ldquo;My wife and I have been very fortunate in our life, we have everything we could every need, and you see so
            many people that have needs that can&#39;t be met. There are people who have the capability to help those individuals,
            who have ability to do great things and just need the funds. Our goal is provide these good causes with the funds
            to do these things.&rdquo;<br />
