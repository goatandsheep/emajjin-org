<h2 class="sub-title">2015: Pathways to Education</h2>

  <p>The recipient charity for 2015 was Pathways to Education.</p>

  <p>Every year, thousands of Canadian students make the life-altering decision to drop out of high school. In some of the countrys most vulnerable neighbourhoods, more than 50 per cent of students do not graduate high school, taking a dramatic toll on our communities, our health and justice systems, and our economy.</p>

  <p>Pathways to Education is helping youth in low-income communities graduate from high school and successfully transition into post-secondary education. Pathways addresses systemic barriers to education by providing leadership, expertise and a community-based program proven to lower dropout rates.</p>

  <p>The Pathways program provides a comprehensive set of academic, financial and social supports to youth. The results of this unique program have been groundbreaking, reducing high school dropout rates by as much as 70 per cent, and increasing the rate at which youth go on to college or university by up to 300 per cent.</p>

  <p>Founded in 2001, Pathways operates nationally across Canada with programs in Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Manitoba and British Columbia.</p>
