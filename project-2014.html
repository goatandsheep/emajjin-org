<h2 class="sub-title">2014: Sanfilippo Children&#39;s Research Foundation</h2>

  <p>The recipient charity for 2014 was the <a href="http://www.alifeforelisa.org/" target="_blank">Sanfilippo Children&#39;s Research Foundation</a>.</p>

  <p>Children with Sanfilippo Syndrome are missing an essential enzyme that breaks down a complex body sugar called heparan sulfate. This sugar slowly builds in the bones, the brain, and other organs stopping normal development and causing hyperactivity, sleep disorders, loss of speech, mental retardation, dementia, and finally death by the mid-teens. There is currently no cure or treatment.</p>

  <p>The goal of the Sanfilippo Children&rsquo;s Research Foundation is to fund medical research to find a cure for Sanfilippo Syndrome and its related neuro-genetic disorders.</p>
