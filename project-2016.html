<h2 class="sub-title">2016: Sleeping Children Around the World</h2>

  <p>We look forward to seeing you on Wednesday October 5th, 2016 for our third annual gala. This year, our recipient charity is <strong><em><u><a href="http://www.scaw.org" target="_blank">Sleeping Children Around The World. (SCAW)</a>.</u></em></strong> Sleeping Children Around the World distributes bedkits to children in a ratio of 50% girls and 50% boys, aged 6-12, from any culture or religion.&nbsp;The core philosophy of this unique charity is that every child should be able to get a good night&#39;s sleep.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The contents of a bedkit vary from country to country, but always contain bedding and a mosquito net, clothing and school supplies. SCAW was founded by Murray and Margaret Dryden in 1970. Since then, the organization has raised over $40 million to provide bedkits for over 1.4 million children in 34 countries.</p>

  <p>This year, we are honoured to have NHL hockey legend Dave Dryden, the current chairman of SCAW, to be speaking at Emajjin&#39;s gala. Live entertainment will be provided by the very talented vocalist/pianist, <a href="http://www.elizapope.com" target="_blank">Eliza Pope</a>.</p>

  <p>As always, our silent auction will offer unique&nbsp;items for everyone: tickets to local shows, weekend getaways, sports events such as Raptors games, wine packages and items for the whole family. Our live auction will feature a family holiday, golf packages and other goodies.</p>

  <p>Join the fun by bidding on these great items and raising money for SCAW!</p>
